This is the implementation of our paper 'Chain of Propagation Prompting for Node Classification'. 

In this paper, we propose using a simple pattern of message-passing, which is based on a weighted multi-hop graph, to prompt self-attention to capture a more complex message-passing pattern, 
resulting in the maximal receptive field and reduced reliance on label information.
